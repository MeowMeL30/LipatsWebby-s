    <h1>R&B LOVE SONG</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I saw you at the club, standing all alone <br>
        Something 'bout your vibe, got me in my zone <br>
        I walked up to you, and asked you for a dance <br>
        You looked me in the eyes, and I got lost in a trance <br>
       <br> 
        Pre-Chorus: <br>
        I know we just met, but I can't resist <br>
        The way you move, it's like we're meant to exist <br>
        I wanna get to know you, and see where this goes <br>
        Let's take it slow, and let the rhythm flow <br> 
       <br> 
        Chorus: <br>
        Let's make some sweet love to this RnB <br>
        Let's take our time, and just let it be <br>
        Let's get lost in each other, and forget about the world <br>
        Let's make some memories, that we'll never forget, girl <br>
       <br> 
        Verse 2: <br>
        Your touch is electric, it sends shivers down my spine <br>
        I never knew love could feel so divine <br>
        The way you whisper in my ear, makes me lose control<br>
        I'm falling for you, and I don't wanna let go<br>
        <br> 
        Pre-Chorus:<br>
        I know we just met, but I can't resist<br>
        The way you move, it's like we're meant to exist<br>
        I wanna get to know you, and see where this goes<br>
        Let's take it slow, and let the rhythm flow<br>
        <br> 
        Chorus:<br>
        Let's make some sweet love to this RnB<br>
        Let's take our time, and just let it be<br>
        Let's get lost in each other, and forget about the world<br>
        Let's make some memories, that we'll never forget, girl<br>
        <br>
        Bridge:<br>
        I don't want this moment to end<br>
        Let's keep dancing, until the night descends<br>
        I want to feel your body next to mine<br>
        And keep this feeling, until the end of time<br>
        <br>
        Chorus:<br>
        Let's make some sweet love to this RnB<br>
        Let's take our time, and just let it be<br>
        Let's get lost in each other, and forget about the world<br>
        Let's make some memories, that we'll never forget, girl<br>
        <br> 
        Outro:<br>
        Let's make some sweet love to this RnB<br>
        Let's make some sweet love to this RnB<br>
        Let's make some sweet love to this RnB<br>
        Let's make some sweet love to this RnB.
